                <div class="h4 mt-0 title">Short Description</div>
                Baruk, o Amaldiçoado, is a battle-hardened barbarian and former member of the Gentle Storm tribe. His life took a tragic turn when a quimera attacked his village, claiming the lives of his beloved wife and son. Filled with grief and anger, he cursed the god Trithereon for not granting him vengeance. In his quest for a worthy opponent to end his life and reunite with his family, he roams the dangerous lands on the fringes of Zattera, yearning for an honorable death in combat.
                <br><br>
                Recently, he relocated to Ahlfar alongside the Icy Triad group, swiftly assuming responsibility for fostering relationships with various groups within the realm of Ortrus.

                <div class="h4 mt-0 title">Biography</div>
                Baruk was once a respected member of the Gentle Storm tribe, serving as their warrior and protector. The tribe, though not warlike, had a strong sense of community and reverence for Trithereon, the god of War, Retribution, and Freedom. Despite his devout beliefs, Baruk always felt a stronger connection to Trithereon than the more popular god, Pelor.
                <br><br>
                Tragedy struck when a quimera attacked the village, resulting in the deaths of his wife, Ansar, and his son, Mirtil. Fueled by grief and a thirst for revenge, Baruk sought to hunt down the creature with the help of two skilled companions, [Barbarugo and Barbalira]. However, upon reaching the quimera's lair, they discovered it had already perished in a rockslide. Feeling betrayed by Trithereon's lack of intervention, Baruk cursed the god, vowing never to pray in his name again.
                <br><br>
                Little did he know, his angry words invoked a curse from Trithereon. Baruk became unable to find a death worthy of a warrior, rendering him virtually invulnerable. Frustrated by his inability to reunite with his family, he now roams the dangerous lands surrounding Kyrgios, seeking a glorious battle that will grant him his much-desired release.
                <br><br>
                <div class="h4 mt-0 title">Personality and Traits</div>
                Baruk is a battle-hardened warrior who carries the weight of his past and the burden of his curse. Despite his gruff exterior, he holds on to a strong sense of honor, refusing to compromise his moral principles or seek an easy way out. He is straightforward and speaks his mind without hesitation. Baruk is driven by a deep desire to reunite with his family and find an honorable death. He is resolute in his belief that Trithereon betrayed him, and this has hardened his heart against divine intervention.
                <br><br>
                Despite his curse, Baruk is still highly skilled in combat and a formidable opponent. He respects other warriors and hopes to find someone who can provide him with the challenge he seeks. He is also empathetic towards the plight of others, especially those who suffer under oppressive rule or in crowded cities. His experiences have given him a certain freedom in being close to death, which has become both a blessing and a curse.
