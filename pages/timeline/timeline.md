                                  <p>As the memory of the devastating wars slowly faded into the annals of history, the cooperation between races signaled the dawning of a new and more peaceful era.

                                  <p>The second war began as an elf's attempt to reclaim lost lands but ended with their decisive defeat when the elf goddess manifested physically and met her demise. Kyrguios fell into chaos, becoming a dead magic zone. The Eye relocated its seat to Tespaysil, which then started colonizing the devastated territories of Menlenor, while the dwarves asserted control over Khordaldrum.</p>

Menlenor safeguarded its western borders, albeit at the cost of halting eastward expansion, while the Sea of Torment served as a southeastern barrier, slowing the demonocracy's global advance.</p>
